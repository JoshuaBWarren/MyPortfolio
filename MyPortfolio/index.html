                                    The Global Learning and Development (GLD) New Hire Oriention (NHO) team needed a platform designed 
                                    to provide a, "one stop shop" location for all things NHO. The goal was to allow for all NHO site locations 
                                    to have a source of information to create a standardized, "Day 1" experience. <br> Joshua chose 
                                    to use SharePoint and created the entire site from the ground up. He managed permissions, created 
                                    and maintained Document Libraries, and subsites for other NHO locations to house their own information. 
                                    <br> During this time he also communicated, updated, and maintained team Wiki's.

                                        The NHO Playbook is a SharePoint Site Collection containing all of the information, processes, 
                                        procedures, and templates used by Amazon during the New Hire Orientation event. It's purpose 
                                        was to create a central location for the flagship Amazon NHO location to share and consolidate 
                                        information as well as providing a way for other NHO locations all over the world a means to 
                                        access this information. <br>

                                        Upon arrival, the GLD NHO Team had a vague idea of what they wanted but didn't know what it 
                                        would look like. They relied heavily on me to create the structure as well as to make 
                                        recommendations for which platforms to use. <br><br>

                                        I did this project in phases:

                                            <li>Consolidate, verify, and update any information I found to ensure it was up-to-date.</li>

                                                        This includes creating SOP templates to increase proccess and procedure 
                                                        efficiency.
                                                    </li>

                                        This training program was for refugee children that was running alongside other 
                                        programs at the Delridge Community Center. I built this program and designed it 
                                        to teach students from ages 10 to 19 how to code, design, and lead teams of other 
                                        students in building a web application.

                                        The program would last for 8 weeks and follow this weekly schedule: 
                                        <ul style="text-align: left;">
                                            <li>Week 1: Introduction to HTML and CSS</li>
                                            <li>Week 2: Continue learning HTML and CSS</li>
                                            <li>Week 3: Introduction to an Agile Environment</li>
                                            <li>Week 4: Form teams and begin projects</li>
                                            <li>Week 5 - 7: Continue projects</li>
                                            <li>Week 8: Present projects</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        During week 3, the students of the class were treated with a trip to the Big Fish 
                                        Games studio. They were able to tour the building and meet the VP of Human 
                                        Resources, Jonathan Maltos. Jonathan talked about how they believed in having fun 
                                        while coming together to make great games. <br>

                                        Next, they were met by the Game Design Manager Brannon Boren to discuss what it 
                                        takes to be a game designer as well as some introspection into what to expect in 
                                        school. <br><br>

                                        As the program manager for the project, it was my job to create the curriculum 
                                        and get feedback to better align it with the objectives for the program. I was 
                                        also present to play the role as the Product Owner so that I could communicate 
                                        to the teams what my requirements were for their projects. 

                                        At he end of the program, I interviewed each student to acquire data about the 
                                        project with the goal of improving the program for future cohorts.

                                        The 2019 Computer Science Internship was working with the University of Washington - 
                                        Bothell's Masters of Computer Science program. Students participating in our internship 
                                        would be able to earn colleg credits through the summer. The internship was unpaid. <br><br>
                                        
                                        My role within the internship was the marketing for, as well as interview, candidates for the
                                        summer program. I also helped drive and create the objectives and tasks the candidates would be 
                                        working on. It was critical that I find the right candidates as the positions we had to 
                                        fill were entirely dependent on the types of tasks and work to be performed. <br><br>

                                        I was also put in charge of the research and acquisition of a suitable workspace that fit both 
                                        the company budget as well as the needs of the team.

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">A more efficient and simple solution.</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/ckwebsite.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p>My role when first hired by this company was to be the Teacher Supervisor. I was to interview, manage, 
                                        mentor, and train teachers who go to schools in the Greater Seattle area to teach kids how to code. <br><br>

                                        I immediately noticed that the employee website that teachers used to log hours and get information about 
                                        the school they were teaching at as well as the curriculum they were teaching, was big and bulky. After 
                                        interviewing many of my teachers, I came to discover that many teachers didn't even use the website for 
                                        anything other than the time sheets. I was also privy to many conversations with administrators about how 
                                        frustrated they were about the site. <br><br>

                                        <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/Teacher View Mock Up.PNG" alt="" />
                                        After conducting many interviews with users and other stakeholders, I crafted an organized and well thought out 
                                        plan complete with a design (above) to pitch to the owner of the company. My project was authorized soon after. <br><br>

                                        From my research, ease of access was the most sought after feature for the site. Both administrators and general 
                                        users wanted to get to where they needed to go in as few clicks as possible while also being able to get more 
                                        information within those clicks. First thing that I did was I created a UX test that had three tasks. A user would 
                                        take this test to complete the three tasks as I timed it. This would provide me a starting metric to test to verify 
                                        project success. <br><br>

                                        <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/CKpopulatedcalendar.jpg" alt="" />
                                        I created all of the Epics, User Stories, and tasks using Azure DevOps (ADO). For teachers, I changed their 
                                        landing page to be a calendar. The calendar would then populate with that specific 
                                        teachers classes for the month. Teachers could click onto that specific class to get more information. Whichever 
                                        class they clicked into would present a new page that has the schools contact information, address, Point of Contact, 
                                        as well as a space for teachers to be able to add new information such as, "Don't park in this parking lot after 5" or 
                                        "New construction on Main street, take 2nd street to get inside.". <br><br>

                                        For administrators, they were to use the same landing page they had been using before, but with a rearranging of informatin. 
                                        All links that had nothing to do with that specific administartors rights would not be visible and all unnecessary 
                                        files were archived. The time sheet page also added more functionality to users by giving them the ability to edit 
                                        past entires (up to a week) and to be able to add in miles driven. <br><br>

                                        During the project, I communicated heavily with users and stakeholders to keep them up-to-date on the progress as well 
                                        as to attain feedback. After the project, the same UX test from before was conducted and each user that took the test 
                                        showed an huge decrease in time required to complete tasks.

                                        <b>Due to a signed agreement, I am unable to provide any pictures or screenshots of this proejct.</b><br><br>

                                        When I was first hired on by BC Group International, I was taken into the Calibration Lab where I met all of the 
                                        calibration technicians by the Service Manager. After the pleasantries, the Service Manager left and that was it. 
                                        That was when I discovered that BC Group didn't have a formal training program for incomming new hires nor was there 
                                        any sort of process in play that would dictate what happens when new hires arrive. Without any direction, I began 
                                        working on a project to remedy this.<br><br>

                                        I took it upon myself to begin grabbing equipment and asking the Calibartion Technicians how to work on them. This was 
                                        the beginning of my training and I took comprehensive notes. I focused on the two main aspects of the training program 
                                        that a new hire would need before traveling to hospital sites: the tech side and the admin side. <br><br>

                                        The tech side had to do with all of the biomedical equipment a new hire might encounter while working. Anything from 
                                        multimeters and safety analyers to defibrillator's and ESU analyers, I began to compile technical documentation to 
                                        create standardized SOP's for new hires to use when they encounter the equipment. The SOP's also came with tech notes 
                                        that dove into the specifications of the equipment, which resistors to turn, and when a piece of equipment was no 
                                        longer qualified to be calibrated and needed repairs or replacement. <br><br>

                                        The admin side had to do with a program called, "Alpha". This program was used by the technician to log information, 
                                        create calibartion certificates, as well as keep an up-to-date list on the equipment a site had. Alpha was a DOS 
                                        program and required training in order to use. <br><br>

                                        I combined all of this into a training book complete with screenshotes of Alpha, SOP's, as well as a recommended 
                                        training timeline for new hires to use. The goal of the project was to make it so that all the Service Manger had 
                                        to do was hand them the training book and the New Hire could begin their training immediately. <br><br>

                                        As a project metric, I used myself. It took me six months of teaching myself as well as getting outside aid before I 
                                        could take a van and begin working as an Onsite Calibration Technician. A trainee was hired on and used my training 
                                        guide and was able to complete everything and get on the road within three months, a 50% decrease.

                                        As the senior technician for my division onboard the USS Enterprise as well as one of the few techs 
                                        onboard who was knowledgable and qualified to work on the GBS system, I played a critical role in the 
                                        replacement, installation, and testing of a new GRC-211 antenna. <br><br>

                                        During deployment, the GRC-211 antenna had been damanged within the dome. The damage was unable to be 
                                        repaired out at sea and on closer inspection it was discovered that the damage itself was such that the 
                                        entire antenna array needed to be replaced. <br><br>

                                        I coordinated with military contractors as well as shore side work crews to coordinate the process. After 
                                        getting the proper permissions, contractors were able to remove the old antenna array so that it could be 
                                        lifted off the ship via crane. The company that we used to purchase the new GRC-211 array arrived and we used 
                                        the crane to lift it up to the top of the mast while contractors, as well as my junior sailors, installed it. <br><br>

                                        After installation, I lead the team and worked with contractors to test the system and ensure everything was installed 
                                        correctly and that the entire system was functioning as it should.
